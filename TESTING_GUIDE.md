## Expected Results

‚úÖ Can create project with images
‚úÖ Project appears in admin list
‚úÖ Eye button opens correct URL
‚úÖ Public projects page shows project
‚úÖ Clicking project card opens detail page
‚úÖ All project fields display correctly
‚úÖ Images load from Cloudinary

## Troubleshooting

### If project doesn't appear on /projects:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Check console for errors
- Verify project has `id` field

### If images don't load:
- Check Cloudinary credentials in .env
- Verify upload was successful
- Check image URL in database

### If detail page shows 404:
- Verify `id` field matches URL
- Check API: http://localhost:3000/api/projects
- Ensure project exists in MongoDB

### If categories don't show:
- Create projects in different categories
- Refresh the page
- Check that category field is filled

## Quick API Tests

### List all projects:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects
```

### Get specific project:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects/test-project-1
```
