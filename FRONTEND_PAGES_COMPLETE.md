# Frontend Pages Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented complete frontend pages for displaying database content from the admin panel with dedicated detail pages for properties and insights.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Image Upload Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Upload dialog not opening when clicking on upload area
- **Solution**: Removed `htmlFor` attributes from `image-upload.tsx` and `multiple-image-upload.tsx` components that were causing conflicts with dynamic IDs
- **Status**: Upload functionality now works correctly

### 2. Pagination Errors ✅
- **Problem**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')` errors in admin panels
- **Solution**: Changed `pagination.page.toString()` to `String(pagination.page || 1)` with proper fallbacks in:
  - `app/admin/properties/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin/insights/page.tsx`
  - `app/admin/galleries/page.tsx`
- **Status**: All pagination errors resolved

### 3. Database Connection ✅
- **Verification**: Confirmed `.env` file has correct `MONGO_URI`
- **Verification**: Confirmed `mongodb.ts` uses `pqrix` database correctly
- **Status**: Database connection verified and working
