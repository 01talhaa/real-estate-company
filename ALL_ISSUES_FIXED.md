# All Issues Fixed and Features Added

## Summary of Changes

All reported issues have been resolved and new features have been successfully implemented.

---

## 1. Database Name Fixed ✅

**Issue**: Database was incorrectly set to `pqrix` instead of `stabit-real-estate`

**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/mongodb.ts` to use correct database name: `stabit-real-estate`
- Database connection now properly connects to: `mongodb+srv://abstalha192:abstalha192@cluster0.q9eyseq.mongodb.net/stabit-real-estate`

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/mongodb.ts` - Changed `db('pqrix')` to `db('stabit-real-estate')`

---

## 2. Insights Author Display Error Fixed ✅

**Issue**: Error when clicking Insights link - "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {name, title, avatar})"

**Root Cause**: The `insight.author` field is an object with `{name, title, avatar}` but was being displayed directly as a string

**Solution**: Fixed author display in multiple components to properly access `author.name`:

**Files Modified**:
1. `app/insights/page.tsx` - Changed `{insight.author}` to `{insight.author?.name || insight.author}`
2. `app/insights/[slug]/page.tsx` - Changed `{insight.author}` to `{typeof insight.author === 'string' ? insight.author : insight.author?.name}`
3. `components/latest-insights-section.tsx` - Already correctly handles with `{typeof insight.author === 'string' ? insight.author : insight.author?.name || 'Unknown'}`

---

## 3. Image Upload Error Handling Improved ✅

**Issue**: Image uploads failing with generic "Upload failed" error without details

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling to show actual Cloudinary error messages

**Files Modified**:
1. `components/image-upload.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const data = await response.json()
   if (!response.ok) {
     console.error('Cloudinary error:', data)
     throw new Error(data.error?.message || 'Upload failed')
   }
   ```

2. `components/multiple-image-upload.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const data = await response.json()
   if (!response.ok) {
     console.error('Cloudinary error:', data)
     throw new Error(data.error?.message || 'Upload failed')
   }
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Shows actual error message from Cloudinary
- Logs full error details to console for debugging
- Helps identify issues like invalid upload preset, incorrect cloud name, etc.

## 8. Next.js 15 Params Fixed ✅

**Issue**: API routes showing warning about accessing params synchronously

**Solution**: Updated all dynamic route params to use `await params` pattern

**Files Modified**:
1. `app/api/properties/[id]/route.ts`:
   - GET: Changed `{ params }: { params: { id: string } }` to `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`
   - PUT: Same change
   - DELETE: Same change
   - All methods now use `const { id } = await params`

2. `app/api/insights/[id]/route.ts`:
   - GET: Same Promise pattern
   - PUT: Same Promise pattern
   - DELETE: Same Promise pattern

**Compliance**: Now follows Next.js 15 async params requirement
