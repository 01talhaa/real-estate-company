# ✅ Image Upload Integration Complete

## What Was Changed

### 1. Environment Variables (.env)
Added Cloudinary and Google Maps configuration:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dmhwqfotb
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=real_estate_upload
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 2. New Components Created

#### ImageUpload Component (`components/image-upload.tsx`)
- Single image upload with drag & drop
- Preview uploaded image
- Delete/remove functionality
- Cloudinary integration
- 10MB file size limit
- Loading state with spinner

#### MultipleImageUpload Component (`components/multiple-image-upload.tsx`)
- Upload multiple images at once
- Drag & drop support
- Image reordering (up/down arrows)
- Individual image removal
- Visual order numbering (#1, #2, etc.)
- Max images limit (configurable)
- Batch upload to Cloudinary

### 3. Forms Updated

#### Property Form (`components/property-form.tsx`)
**Replaced URL inputs with uploads:**
- ✅ Featured Image → ImageUpload component
- ✅ Property Images → MultipleImageUpload (max 20)
- ✅ Floor Plans → MultipleImageUpload (max 10)
- ⚠️ Virtual Tour URL → Kept as URL input (external links)

#### Insight Form (`components/insight-form.tsx`)

#### Gallery Form (`components/gallery-form.tsx`)
**Replaced URL inputs with uploads:**
- ✅ Gallery Images → ImageUpload per image with reordering

## How It Works

### Image Upload Flow:
1. User selects image from device or drags & drops
2. Component validates file (type, size)
3. Creates FormData with image file
4. Uploads directly to Cloudinary API
5. Receives secure URL from Cloudinary
6. Stores URL in form state
7. Shows success toast notification

### Cloudinary Configuration:
- **Cloud Name**: dmhwqfotb (from your existing account)
- **Upload Preset**: real_estate_upload (needs to be created - see CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md)
- **Upload Type**: Unsigned (client-side uploads)
- **Storage**: All images stored in your Cloudinary account
- **URLs**: Secure HTTPS URLs with automatic optimization

### Google Maps Integration:
- **Geocoding**: Convert address to coordinates in property form
- **API Key**: Needs to be added to .env
- **Location Tab**: "Get Coordinates" button in property form
- **Storage**: Coordinates stored in MongoDB for map display

## Setup Required

### 1. Cloudinary Upload Preset (REQUIRED)
Follow instructions in `CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md`:
- Login to Cloudinary dashboard
- Create unsigned upload preset named: `real_estate_upload`
- Takes 2 minutes

### 2. Google Maps API Key (OPTIONAL - for geocoding)
Follow instructions in `GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md`:
- Create Google Cloud project
- Enable Geocoding API
- Get API key
- Update .env file

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Upload

### Test Property Image Upload:
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/properties/new`
2. Navigate to "Gallery & SEO" tab
3. Click on "Featured Image" upload area
4. Select an image from your computer
5. Wait for upload (shows spinner)
6. Image should appear with preview
7. Click X to remove if needed

### Test Multiple Images:
1. Same page, scroll to "Property Images"
2. Click upload area
3. Select multiple images at once
4. All upload simultaneously
5. Use ↑↓ buttons to reorder
6. Use X to remove individual images

## Security

✅ **Client-side uploads** - No API secrets exposed
✅ **Unsigned preset** - Cloudinary handles security
✅ **File validation** - Type and size checks
✅ **Environment variables** - Sensitive data in .env
✅ **Error handling** - Graceful failure messages

## Support

If uploads aren't working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Cloudinary upload preset exists and is "Unsigned"
3. Check .env variables are correct
4. Restart development server
5. Clear browser cache
6. Test with different image file

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Cloudinary Setup** (see CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md)
2. **Test Image Uploads** in admin panel
3. **Add Google Maps Key** (optional, for geocoding)
4. **Create Frontend Pages** to display properties with images
5. **Implement Image Galleries** on property detail pages

**Ready to Test!** 🚀

All image upload functionality is implemented. Just need to create the Cloudinary upload preset and you can start uploading images directly from the admin panel!
