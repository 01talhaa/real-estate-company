## 🚀 Usage Flow

### Admin Creating a Client
1. Go to `/admin/clients`
2. Click "Add Client"
3. Fill in client details + upload avatar
4. Submit → Client created with hashed password

### Client Registration
1. Click "Client Login" in header
2. Click "Register here"
3. Fill registration form
4. Submit → Auto-login + redirect to dashboard

### Client Login
1. Click "Client Login" in header
2. Enter email & password
3. Submit → Redirect to dashboard

### Client Dashboard
1. View assigned projects & services
2. Click cards to see full details
3. Logout when done

## 🔄 Client-Project-Service Relationship

### How to Assign Projects/Services to Clients
When editing a client in admin panel, you can:
1. Add project IDs to `projects` array
2. Add service IDs to `services` array

The dashboard will automatically:
- Fetch all projects matching client's project IDs
- Fetch all services matching client's service IDs
- Display them in organized sections

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure `MONGO_URI` is set in `.env`
2. **JWT Secret**: Set `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` (or uses default)
3. **Cloudinary**: Profile images use existing `/api/upload` endpoint
4. **Admin vs Client**: Separate authentication systems
   - Admin: `admin-session` cookie
   - Client: `client_token` cookie

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Email verification on registration
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Client profile edit page
- [ ] Booking flow integration (assign services to clients)
- [ ] Project assignment from admin panel
- [ ] Client notifications system
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Activity logs

## ✨ Summary

- ✅ Full CRUD operations in admin panel
- ✅ Client authentication (signup/login/logout)
- ✅ Protected client dashboard
- ✅ Project & service assignment tracking
- ✅ Cloudinary profile image upload
- ✅ Beautiful light theme UI
